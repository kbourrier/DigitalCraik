This GitHub account is a repository for Digital Dinah Craik project files. Here, you will find an updated version of our Craik Site Index (our project's TEI prosopography, placeography, orgography, and bibliography) as well as our current Digital Dinah Craik codebook. All TEI letters can be found at [Digital Dinah Craik on TAPAS](http://tapasproject.org/node/443). These project files are currently works-in-progress. We welcome feedback as we refine our work.
